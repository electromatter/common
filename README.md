# common
A repository containing some common data-structures and algorithms that I use.
I seperated this out into it's own repo, because I tend to copy these files
around a lot. So instead of creating may different versions, keep one central
repo.

- AES (non-ni) depends on OpenSSL.
- Some depend on mcp_base
- sock depends on libev and `extern struct ev_loop *loop;`
